;; This library provides the command `dired-find-duplicates' which searches a directory for
;; duplicates of the marked files in the current dired buffer.
;; It requires that the unix find and md5sum commands are on your system.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put dired-dups.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'dired-dups)

(defun dired-find-duplicates (files dir)
  "Find duplicates of files and put them in a dired buffer.
FILES is a list of files which will be compared. DIR is the directory
which will be checked for duplicates of any of the files in the list.
Any matching files will be placed in a new dired buffer with name
*duplicated files*.
When called interactively from a dired buffer, the marked files in that dired buffer will
be treated as the orginals whose duplicates are to be found, and the user will be prompted
for a directory to search for duplicates.
If the function is called with 1 prefix arg then the original files that have duplicates
will be marked for deletion.
With 2 prefix args the files in the *duplicate files* buffer will be marked for deletion.
With 3 prefix args the original files will be placed in the *duplicated files* buffer,
interleaved with the duplicates (original file first, followed by duplicates), and 
the original files will be marked for deletion.
With 4 prefix args the behaviour is the same as with 3 prefix args except that the 
duplicate files will be marked for deletion instead of the originals."
