;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Description:
;;
;; `dired-toggle' provide an simple way to toggle dired buffer for
;; current directory(similar to `dired-jump'), and the target buffer
;; is specified so that it will be divided from other dired buffers,
;; for example the dired buffer only shown in a special name which
;; could be edit through the variable `dired-toggle-buffer-name', and
;; it will include a minor mode named `dired-toggle-mode' to ensure
;; all the actions(such as change directory and open a selected file)
;; under the dired buffer will not influence other dired buffers and
;; works as we expected.
;;
;; You could custom the toggled window's size and side through
;; variable `dired-toggle-window-size' and `dired-toggle-window-side'.
;;
;; Source: https://github.com/fasheng/dired-toggle
;;
;; Tips: For a good user experience you may want to use
;; `dired-details.el' or `dired-hide-details-mode' if use Emacs 24.4
;; or later.
;;
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Just add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'dired-toggle)
;;
;; You could also custom functions after `dired-toggle-mode' enabled,
;; for example enable `visual-line-mode' for our narrow dired buffer:
;;
;; (add-hook 'dired-toggle-mode-hook
;;           (lambda () (interactive)
;;             (visual-line-mode 1)
;;             (setq-local visual-line-fringe-indicators '(nil right-curly-arrow))
;;             (setq-local word-wrap nil)))
;;
;;
;; Default key-bindings:
;;
;; | "q"       | dired-toggle-action-quit         |
;; | "RET"     | dired-toggle-action-find-file    |
;; | "^"       | dired-toggle-action-up-directory |
;; | "C-c C-u" | dired-toggle-action-up-directory |
