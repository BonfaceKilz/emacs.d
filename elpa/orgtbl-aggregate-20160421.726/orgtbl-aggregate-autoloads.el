(autoload 'orgtbl-to-aggregated-table "orgtbl-aggregate" "\
Convert the orgtbl-mode TABLE to another orgtbl-mode table
with material aggregated.
Grouping of rows is done for identical values of grouping columns.
For each group, aggregation (sum, mean, etc.) is done for other columns.
  
The source table must contain sending directives with the following format:
#+ORGTBL: SEND destination orgtbl-to-aggregated-table :cols ... :cond ...

The destination must be specified somewhere in the same file
with a bloc like this:
  #+BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL destination
  #+END RECEIVE ORGTBL destination

:cols     gives the specifications of the resulting columns.
          It is a space-separated list of column specifications.
          Example:
             P Q sum(X) max(X) mean(Y)
          Which means:
             group rows with similar values in columns P and Q,
             and for each group, compute the sum of elements in
             column X, etc.

          The specification for a resulting column may be:
             COL              the name of a grouping column in the source table
             hline            a special name for grouping rows separated
                              by horizontal lines
             count()          give the number of rows in each group
             list(COL)        list the values of the column for each group
             sum(COL)         compute the sum of the column for each group
             sum(COL1*COL2)   compute the sum of the product of two columns
                              for each group
             mean(COL)        compute the average of the column for each group
             mean(COL1*COL2)  compute the average of the product of two columns
                              for each group
             meane(COL)       compute the average along with the estimated error
             hmean(COL)       compute the harmonic average
             gmean(COL)       compute the geometric average
             median(COL)      give the middle element after sorting them
             max(COL)         gives the largest element of each group
             min(COL)         gives the smallest element of each group
             sdev(COL)        compute the standard deviation (divide by N-1)
             psdev(COL)       compute the population standard deviation (divide by N)
             pvar(COL)        compute the variance
             prod(COL)        compute the product
             cov(COL1,COL2)   compute the covariance of two columns
                              for each group (divide by N-1)
             pcov(COL1,COL2)  compute the population covariance of two columns
                              for each group (/N)
             corr(COL1,COL2)  compute the linear correlation of two columns

:cond     optional
          a lisp expression to filter out rows in the source table
          when the expression evaluate to nil for a given row of the source table,
          then this row is discarded in the resulting table
          Example:
             (equal Q \"b\")
          Which means: keep only source rows for which the column Q has the value b

Columns in the source table may be in the dollar form,
for example $3 to name the 3th column,
or by its name if the source table have a header.
If all column names are in the dollar form,
the table is supposed not to have a header.
The special column name \"hline\" takes values from zero and up
and is incremented by one for each horizontal line.

Example:
add a line like this one before your table
,#+ORGTBL: SEND aggregatedtable orgtbl-to-aggregated-table :cols \"sum(X) q sum(Y) mean(Z) sum(X*X)\"
then add somewhere in the same file the following lines:
,#+BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL aggregatedtable
,#+END RECEIVE ORGTBL aggregatedtable
Type C-c C-c into your source table

Note:
 This is the 'push' mode for aggregating a table.
 To use the 'pull' mode, look at the org-dblock-write:aggregate function.
