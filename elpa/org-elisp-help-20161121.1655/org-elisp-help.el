;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines two additional Org link types "elisp-function"
;; and "elisp-variable" which are intended to be used mainly in user
;; documentation.  By default opening these links is done by calling
;; `describe-function' and `describe-variable'.  That is only possible
;; when the function/variable is defined; therefor urls should include
;; the library defining the respective symbol.  If the symbol is not
;; `fbound'/`bound' when the link is opened and the url contains
;; information about the defining feature then that is loaded first.

;;   [[elisp-function:FEATURE:SYMBOL][...]]
;;   [[elisp-variable:FEATURE:SYMBOL][...]]
;;   [[elisp-function::SYMBOL][...]]
;;   [[elisp-variable::SYMBOL][...]]

;; If you want to capture information about a symbol while working on
;; elisp code you should instead use the "elisp-symbol" Org link type
;; defined in `org-elisp-symbol' (which is distributed with Org-Mode).
;; The link types defined here cannot be captured as that would
;; conflict with the "elisp-symbol" type.  Instead use the command:

;;   `org-elisp-help-function-insert-link' and
;;   `org-elisp-help-variable-insert-link'.
