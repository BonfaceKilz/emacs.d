;; 1 Overview
;; ==========

;;   This simple package is mainly used for Elisp package writers. After
;;   you've written the `README.org' for your package, you can use
;;   `org2elcomment' to convert the org file to Elisp comments in the
;;   corresponding source code file.


;; 2 Usage
;; =======

;;   Make sure your source code file has `;;; Commentary:' and `;;; Code:'
;;   lines. The generated comments will be put between these two lines. If
;;   you use `auto-insert', it will take care of generating a standard file
;;   header that contains these two lines in your source code.


;; 2.1 Command `org2elcomment'
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   In your Org file, invoke `org2elcomment', select the source code file,
;;   and done! Now take a look at your source code file, you can see your
;;   Org file has been converted to the comments in your source code file.


;; 2.2 Command `org2elcomment-anywhere'
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   You can invoke this command anywhere in Emacs. It requires two
;;   parameters. You need to select the source code file as well as the org
;;   file. After selecting the org file, you can optionally save the org
;;   file location as the file-local variable in the source code file so
;;   that you don't need to select the org file again for the same source
;;   code file.

;;   If you want to automate the process of converting the org to the
;;   commentary section in Elisp file in your project, you can consider
;;   using this command.


;; 3 Customization
;; ===============

;; 3.1 Org Export Backend
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Behind the scenes, this package uses `org-export-as' function and the
;;   default backend is `ascii'. You can change to whatever backend that
;;   your org-mode export engine supports, such as `md' (for markdown):

;;   ,----
;;   | (setq org2elcomment-backend 'md)
;;   `----


;; 3.2 Exporter Function
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   In fact, it is even possible to use your own export function instead
;;   of the exporter of org-mode. Write a function which accepts a file
;;   name of an org file and returns the string as the export result. Here
;;   is how the default exporter that we use in this package looks like:

;;   ,----
;;   | (defun org2elcomment-default-exporter (org-file)
;;   |   (with-temp-buffer
;;   |     (insert-file-contents org-file)
;;   |     (org-export-as org2elcomment-backend)))
;;   `----

;;   After defining your own export function, say, `my-exporter', change
;;   the value of `org2elcomment-exporter':

;;   ,----
;;   | (setq org2elcomment-exporter 'my-exporter)
;;   `----

;;; Code:
