;; * org-webpage README                                                 :README:

;; org-webpage is a static site generator based on [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]],
;; which code derived from Kelvin H's [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]].

;; The main differents of two projects are as follow:

;; 1. org-webpage's core *don't hard code git*, its process is like below:
;;    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

;;   [ Org files in repository]  [ Website project configure ]

;;                |                           |
;;           < Export >                 < Generate >
;;                |                           |

;;          [ HTML files ]               [ Uploader ]  <- ( Uploader is a bash script )

;;                |                           |
;;                |                           |
;;                +-------------+-------------+
;;                              |
;;                              |
;;                      < Run Uploader >  <- ( For example: git uploader, rclone uploader or others )
;;                              |
;;                              |

;;                          [ REMOTE ]

;;    #+END_EXAMPLE

;; 2. org-webpage's default config is `org-publish-project-alist' style alist,
;;    which can manage multi-site configs in an emacs session easily.
;; 3. org-website find theme-files from a *themes-list* in sequence and same theme-file
;;    first found will be used. User can set *fallback theme* with the help of this feature.
;; 4. org-website include a tiny emacs web server, which can be used to test publish.
;; 5. org-website can use other uploaders to upload website, for example: rclone.
;; 6. ...

;; ** Installation

;; org-webpage is now available from the famous emacs package repo [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][melpa]]
;; so the recommended way is to install it through emacs package
;; management system. For more info about installation, please see
;; *tips.org* in the "doc" folder.

;; ** Configuration
;; org-webpage use variable `owp/project-config-alist' to store all projects's configures, user
;; can add a project with the help of `add-to-list' function, but the easiest way is
;; using `owp/add-project-config' function.

;; The follow code is [[http://tumashu.github.com][my website]]'s [[https://github.com/tumashu/tumashu.github.com/blob/source/eh-website.el][config]],
;; you can adjust and paste it to your =.emacs= file:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/org-webpage") ; Only needed if you install org-webpage manually

;; (require 'org-webpage)

;; (owp/add-project-config
;;  '("tumashu.github.com"
;;    :repository-directory "~/project/emacs-packages/tumashu.github.com"
;;    :remote (git "https://github.com/tumashu/tumashu.github.com.git" "master")
;;    ;; you can use `rclone` with `:remote (rclone "remote-name" "/remote/path/location")` instead.
;;    :site-domain "http://tumashu.github.com/"
;;    :site-main-title "Tumashu 的个人小站"
;;    :site-sub-title "(九天十地，太上忘情！！！)"
;;    :theme (worg)
;;    :source-browse-url ("Github" "https://github.com/tumashu/tumashu.github.com")
;;    :personal-avatar "/media/img/horse.jpg"
;;    :personal-duoshuo-shortname "tumashu-website"
;;    :web-server-port 7654))
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; [[https://github.com/tumashu/chinese-pyim][Chinese-pyim]] 's org-webpage [[https://github.com/tumashu/chinese-pyim/blob/master/chinese-pyim-devtools.el][config]] is a more complex example.

;; You can find more config options and theirs default values by commands:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; C-h v owp/project-config-alist
;; C-h v owp/config-fallback
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; ** Publication

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; M-x owp/do-publication
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; ** Dependencies

;; 1. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]: this is an "of-course" dependency
;; 2. [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]]: v8.0 is required, please use =M-x org-version <RET>= to make sure you org mode version is not less than 8.0
;; 3. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/][bash]]: the GNU Project's shell
;; 4. [[http://git-scm.com][git]]: a free and open source version control system
;; 5. [[http://rclone.org/downloads/][rclone]]: support to other remote locations, see rclone's overview for more information. (Optional)
;; 6. [[https://github.com/Wilfred/mustache.el][mustache.el]]: a mustache templating library for Emacs
;; 7. [[http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el.cgi][htmlize.el]]: a library for syntax highlighting (usually this library is shipped with emacs)
;; 8. [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]]: a modern list library for Emacs
;; 9. [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht.el]]: a modern hash-table library for Emacs
;; 10. [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][simple-httpd]]: Extensible Emacs HTTP 1.1 server

;; ** Known issues

;; 1. Currently the deletion change handler has not been implemented so
;;    if you deleted some org sources, you may have to manually delete
;;    corresponding generated html files.
;; 2. URI path change detection is not available. That is, if you make a
;;    post with the URI "/blog/2013/03/25/the-old-post-name" and then
;;    change this value in your org source, org-webpage would be unable to
;;    detect that this has happened. it will only publish a new html
;;    file for you so you need to delete the old html file related to
;;    the old URI manually.
