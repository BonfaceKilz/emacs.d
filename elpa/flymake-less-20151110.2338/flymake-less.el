;;
;; Beware that lessc is quite slow, so there can be a significant lag
;; between editing and the highlighting of resulting errors.
;;
;; Like the author's many other flymake-*.el extensions, this code is
;; designed to configure flymake in a buffer-local fashion, which
;; avoids the dual pitfalls of 1) inflating the global list of
;; `flymake-err-line-patterns' and 2) being required to specify the
;; matching filename extensions (e.g. "*.css") redundantly.
;;
;; Uses flymake-easy, from https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy
