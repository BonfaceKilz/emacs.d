;; Keywords: Dropbox Android notes org-mode

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This minor mode syncs DropBox notes from mobile devices into org
;; datetree file that can be part of org agenda. The minor mode starts
;; a daemon that periodically scans the note directory.
;;
;; ** Justification
;;
;; I wanted to collect together all interesting articles I saw reading
;; news on my phone applications. I was already using Org mode to keep
;; notes in my computer.
;;
;; The [[http://orgmode.org/manual/MobileOrg.html][MobileOrg]] app in
;; my Android phone is fiddly and does not do things the way I want,
;; so this was a good opportunity to learn lisp while doing something
;; useful.
;;
;; ** Sharing notes
;;
;; On Android phones, installing Dropbox client also adds Dropbox as
;; one of the applications that can be used to share articles from
;; many news applications (e.g. BBC World News, Flipboard). In
;; contrast to many other options, Dropbox saves these links as plain
;; text files -- a good starting point for including them into
;; org-mode.
;;
;; Org mode has a date-ordered hierachical file structure called
;; datetree that is ideal for storing notes and links. This
;; org-dropbox-mode code reads each note in the Dropbox notes folder,
;; formats them to an org element, and refiles them to a correct place
;; in a datetree file for easy searching through org-agenda commands.
;;
;; Each new org headline element gets an inactive timestamp that
;; corresponds to the last modification time of the note file.
;;
;; The locations in the filesystem are determined by two customizable
;; variables -- by default both pointing inside Dropbox:
;;
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;;   org-dropbox-note-dir      "~/Dropbox/notes/"
;;   org-dropbox-datetree-file "~/Dropbox/org/reference.org"
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; Since different programmes format the shared link differently, the
;; code tries its best to make sense of them. A typical note has the
;; name of the article in the first line and the link following it
;; separated by one or two newlines. The name is put to the header,
;; multiple new lines are reduced to one, and the link is followed by
;; the timestamp. If the title uses dashes (' - '), exclamation marks
;; ('! '), or colons (': '), they are replaced by new lines to wrap
;; the trailing text into the body. In cases where there is no text
;; before the link, the basename of the note file is used as the
;; header.
;;
;; After parsing, the source file is removed from the note directory.
;;
;; Note that most of the time the filename is ignored. The only
;; absolute requirement for the filename is that it has to be unique
;; within the directory. Filename is used as an entry header only if
;; the file does not contain anything usefull, i.e. the content is
;; plain URL.
;;
;; ** Usage
;;
;; Set up variables =org-dropbox-note-dir= and
;; =org-dropbox-datetree-file= to your liking. Authorize your devices
;; to share that Dropbox directory. As long as you save your notes in
;; the correct Dropbox folder, they are copied to your computer for
;; processing and deletion.
;;
;; The processing of notes starts when you enable the minor mode
;; org-dropbox-mode in Emacs, and stops when you disable it. After
;; every refiler run, a message is printed out giving the number of
;; notes processed.
;;
;; An internal timer controls the periodic running of the notes
;; refiler. The period is set in customizable variable
;; =org-dropbox-refile-timer-interval= to run by default every hour
;; (3600 seconds).
;;
;; ** Disclaimer
;;
;; This is first time I have written any reasonable amount of lisp
;; code, so writing a whole package was a jump in the dark. The code has
;; been running reliably for some time now, but if you want to try the
;; code and be absolutely certain you do not lose your notes, comment
;; form =(delete-file file)= from the code.
;;
;; There are undoubtedly many things that can be done better. Feel
;; free to raise issues and submit pull requests.
