;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides some basic utilities for working with Lua
;; code from within AUCTeX.  `LaTeX-edit-Lua-code-start' is the entry
;; point of this package; bind it to your favorite key and use it
;; inside of any environment in `LaTeX-Lua-environments'.  To commit
;; your changes to the parent buffer and return to it, simply use
;; `save-buffer' (or whichever key it is bound to).  The contents of
;; the parent buffer will be updated and the Lua buffer will be killed.
;; 
;; Beware!  Editing embedded Lua code is asynchronous.  If you kill
;; the buffer that was editing it, your changes will be lost!  In a
;; future update I will add a `yes-or-no-p' confirmation to killing
;; the buffer, but I've yet to figure that one out.
