;;; Commentary:

;; This file makes org-babel aware of the org-if language.

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language
(require 'org-if-interpreter)
(require 'org-if-mode)

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:org-if
  '((:results . "no"))
  "Default header arguments for org-if SRC blocks.")

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;;###autoload
(defun org-babel-execute:org-if (body params)
  "Execute a block of ORG-IF code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'"
  (message "executing ORG-IF source code block")
  (org-if-interpret body))

(provide 'ob-org-if)
;;; ob-org-if.el ends here
