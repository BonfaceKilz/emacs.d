;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines the major mode org-if-mode for the purposes of
;; syntax highlighting. You should never create a .org-if file.
;; This is only to make org-babel src blocks highlight org-if code correctly.

;;; Code:

(require 'easymenu)
(require 'generic-x)
(require 'org)

;;;###autoload
(define-generic-mode
  'org-if-mode
  '(";")
  '("choice" "if" "print" "reset" "set" "=" "+" "-" "*" "/"
    "<" "<=" "=" ">=" ">" "!=")
  nil
  '("\\.org-if$") ; For testing purposes only
  nil
  "Major mode for ORG-IF programming language.")

(easy-menu-define org-if-menu org-mode-map "Org IF menu"
  '("Org-IF"
    ["Active"      toggle-org-if-active-mode :style toggle :selected org-if-active-mode]
    ["Save & Quit" org-if-save-and-quit      :active org-if-active-mode]
    ["Restore"     org-if-restore            :active (not org-if-active-mode)]))

(provide 'org-if-mode)
;;; org-if-mode.el ends here
