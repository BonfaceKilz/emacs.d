;;     lr-remove-duplicates: redefined.
;; 2005/10/19 dadams
;;     lib-requires-tree:
;;       More or less reverted changes from 10/18: Use require, not
;;       load-library; don't bind load-history to nil.
;;       Updated doc string to speak of feature, not library (likewise, text
;;       of lib-requires-header).
;; 2005/10/18 dadams
;;     Added: lib-requires-header.
;;     lib-requires-tree:
;;       Updated doc string to mention byte-compiled libraries.
;;       Use load-library, not require.
;;       Bind load-history to nil around it, to ensure use latest requires.
;;     insert-lib-requires-as-comment: Insert "None" instead of error if none.
;; 2005/10/03 dadams
;;     require cl.el for Emacs 22 too, for remove-duplicates.
;;
;;  Acknowledgement: Thanks to Kevin Rodgers <ihs_4664@yahoo.com> for
;;  feedback about the original version of `libreq-requires-tree'.

;;;###autoload
(defun libreq-requires-tree (library &optional cumul)
  "The features `require'd by LIBRARY, as a tree.
The tree structure shows library dependencies: Each feature is
represented by its name or by a list of its name followed by the
features that it explicitly requires.

Argument LIBRARY is an Emacs-Lisp file name, or file name sans
extension.  This command loads LIBRARY before determining its
dependencies.  This means that LIBRARY must contain (provide LIBRARY).
If it does not, an error is raised.

Function `libreq-requires-tree' calls itself recursively on its
dependencies, so an attempt is made to load all of them.

Note: If a byte-compiled (`*.elc') version of a library is
available, it is loaded, in preference to the source library -
this is the standard behavior of `load-library'.  This means that
the tree of required features reflects the dependencies indicated
in the byte-compiled file, not the source file.  If the
byte-compiled file is out-of-date, so will be the result of
`libreq-requires-tree'.

A required feature that was loaded successfully is represented by a
  string that names the required feature.
A required file or feature that failed to load is represented by a
  symbol that names the required feature.

For example: Suppose that library `doremi.el' requires `ring+' and
`mwheel', and library `ring+' requires `ring'.  If `ring+' is
successfully loaded and `mwheel.el' is not, then the result is this:

  (mwheel (\"ring+\" (\"ring\")))

Argument CUMUL is used only for recursive calls, to accumulate the
required features.

See also command `libreq-requires-list'.

Note that `libreq-requires-tree' and `libreq-requires-list' are
roughly the opposite of `file-dependents' in library `loadhist'."
