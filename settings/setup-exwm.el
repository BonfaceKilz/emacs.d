;; All buffers created in EXWM mode are named "*EXWM*". You may want to

;; some advice on this topic:
;; + Always use `exwm-workspace-rename-buffer` to avoid naming conflict.
;; + For applications with multiple windows (e.g. GIMP), the class names of
;    all windows are probably the same.  Using window titles for them makes
;;   more sense.
;; In the following example, we use class names for all windows expect for
;; Java applications and GIMP.
